## Data Science Projects:

[Rossmann Store Sales](https://github.com/CaioMendes92/RossmannStoreSales)

I used Python, data analysis and machine learning techniques to find a solution that would predict each store's prices over the next six weeks. And the result of this solution, if implemented, would be over $200MM dollars in revenue.

[Health Insurance Cross Sell](https://github.com/CaioMendes92/health_insurance_cross_sell)

I used Python, data analysis and Machine Learning techniques to find a solution that ranked the best customers to offer a health insurance service.

[Power BI analysis of ENEM candidates](https://github.com/CaioMendes92/Teste-Analista-de-Dados-MESHA)

I used Power BI to create a dashboard with ENEM candidates and your pontuations.

[Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/CaioMendes92/customer_segmentation)

I used Python, data analysis and Machine Learning techniques to find a solution that meets customer patterns and generate a cluster whose in-store spend generated 50% revenue. Each of the clusters generated was developed a strategy by the marketing team to leverage the company's sales.
